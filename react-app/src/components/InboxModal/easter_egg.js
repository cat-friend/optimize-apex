        <div className="egg">Literally, you are an inspiration--you inspired this project and you inspire me to be a better person. I really don't
            know where to begin because there is so much about our friendship and about you that I am thankful for and love so
            much.
            You've been such a great support, directly and by proxy through the people who you've introduced me to, during the
            most
            agonizing period of my life. To go through a divorce is hard. I decided to
            undertake all three simultaneously. I've only been able to get through the hardest periods of my life because of my
            support network. I am so thankful that you are part of my support network. You truly are a gift and a treasure, a perpetual gift-giving machine, a treasure pack
            that I would pick up every day.</div>

        <div className="egg">This project is a labor of love for you, for all the cool people who I've met through you, and is the, *ahem*, apex
            of
            my engineering abilities. I hope that it has met all of your expectations and fulfills all of your wildest dreams
            and
            also that DQ likes it, too, even if she may not understand your desire to be an efficient killer. To go through a pandemic is hard. To go through a bootcamp is hard. Elysium!!

        <div className="egg">Heeennnnllooo. My pal, Green Pepski, I have the best time with you. You are so fun and kind and caring and I am so
            thankful to know, to love, and to be loved by you. The pandemic, my divorce, and bootcamp have been really hard on
            me but your friendship has helped me endure the most angonizing period of my life. I could not have done this
            without you, without your sympathetic ear, without your words of compassion, without your sense of humor, and
            without your OH MY GAAAH SICK AIM SKRILLZ</div>
        <div className="egg">Thank you for welcoming me into your life. It has been a real delight to be a part of it and I'm looking forward to
            many, many, manayaamannayayaanamnay more years of kekeing in bideo jems with you and the rest of the pep-peps.</div>

        <div className="egg"><i>Ultimate Accelerator</i>, or as it's known colloquially <i>Dolphismyfriend's apex legends combo wombo app for my
            friend Dolph</i> started off as a labor of love for Dolph but has evolved to represent so much more. This
            project is the... <i>apex</i> demonstration of my coding ability and is partially dedicated to you. I
            wouldn't be here if it weren't for your companionship on those sleepless nights during of one of the most agonizing
            and isolating periods of my life. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for your support and encouragement when I felt
            like I was faltering, when I really wanted to take a month off to fake my own death and disappear forever.</div>

        <div className="egg">Thank you for your openness, poop memes, sexy Shrek gifs, agreeing with me that I'm cute that one time, welcoming me back, and
            everything in between. I really appreciate that you let me into your life and have let me bully you
            about not having a chair or internet, accompanied me in spooky hallways while we hunt ghoaststs (more like
            serenading me while I shrieked my stupid head off), share in my goatse appreciation, and shared your job hunt progress and some of your
            fee-fees with me. You mean a lot to me and I hope that you not only know this but feel it, too. I really love and miss you and hope that we can have that openness that we once had between us
            again.

    8: (<><div className="egg">Umbasa,</div>

        <div className="egg">When we first met, you were very quiet. You are still quiet but I appreciate that you have more or less resigned to
            accept the friendship that I have forced upon you. There was a day in Discord quite a few months ago--this was back
            when Yoshi still played in the morning. I think it was me, Yoshi, Blueberry, and Green Pepper at first and I
            remarked, "Hey, almost everyone has a color in their name!" So I changed my name to a color. As people trickled in,
            they changed their names to include colors too. When you changed your name to "umber nova" I was like, "YES.
            FINALLY. WE ARE FRIENDS." :3</div>
        <div className="egg">Thank you for sharing music with me. It really delights me when people share playlists with me because I feel like
            I've gained insight into their lives. Like, "Oh! Maybe Umbasa listens to this while he's cleaning his house or he
            sings along to this while he washes his dogs.". I hope we're friends for a long time because it has been really cool
            to play Apex with you and to keke with you.</div>
        <div className="egg">Always,<br />
            Denise</div></>),
    10: (<><div className="egg">Nathan,</div>
        <div className="egg">I met Dolph through you. Before Dolph and I first played Apex together, I communicated to him which goons
            I'm not comfortable playing with. He told me who he regularly plays with and said, "blueberry is :100:". He's not
            wrong. There have been a few times where you've said or done something and I think, "Man, Bloobs is such a good
            dad." I
            don't have a relationship with my father and it really comforts me to know that my experiences as his daughter are
            more anomalous than they are the norm and that there are good fathers out there. Your family is lucky to have you!
            Green Pepp and I are lucky to have you
            as one of the vertices of this food pyramid!</div>
        <div className="egg">To go through a pandemic is hard. To go through a bootcamp is hard. To go through a divorce is hard. I decided to
            undertake all three simultaneously. I've only been able to get through the hardest periods of my life because of my
            support network. I am so thankful that you are part of my support network. I really appreciate your sense of humor
            and openness and compassion and that you go along with my stupid jokes (I still need to try the Advanced Technique
            on Yoshi). Thank you so much for your help with this project. It has
            been really cool bonding experience and I am very thankful for your brain and your patience and your friendship.</div>
